    SO2 refers to sulphur dioxide, a gas that mainly comes from burning sulphur-containing fuels in industrial processes.
    Sulphur dioxide is a harmful air pollutant and high levels are linked to respiratory issues and other health problems.
    Sulphur dioxide is measured in parts per billion (ppb).
</p>

<p>
    This sulphur dioxide scale is guidelines from based on the 2025 Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) 1-hour management levels for outdoor air across Canada.
    These levels are established by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME).
</p>

<p>
    The purpose of this scale is to provide context to the raw sulphur dioxide values.
    It should not be interpreted as a direct representation of human health risk.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Scale:</b>
</p>
 <ul> 
 <li>&nbsp;≤30&nbsp;ppb&nbsp; Low</li>
 <li>&nbsp;30.1&nbsp;-&nbsp;50&nbsp;ppb&nbsp; Medium</li>
 <li>&nbsp;50.1&nbsp;-&nbsp;65&nbsp;ppb&nbsp; High</li>
 <li>&nbsp;&gt;65&nbsp;ppb&nbsp; Very High</li>
</ul>
