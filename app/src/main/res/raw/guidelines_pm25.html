    PM 2.5 refers to fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller.
    These tiny particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream and cause health problems.
    PM 2.5 is measured in micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³).
</p>

<p>
    This PM 2.5 scale is based on guidelines from the 2030 Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) 24-hour management levels for outdoor air across Canada.
    These levels are established by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME).
</p>

<p>
    The purpose of this scale is to provide context to the raw PM 2.5 values.
    It should not be interpreted as a direct representation of human health risk.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Scale:</b>
</p>
 <ul> 
 <li>≤10&nbsp;µg/m³&nbsp; Low</li>
 <li>10.1&nbsp;-&nbsp;16&nbsp;µg/m³&nbsp; Medium</li>
 <li>16.1&nbsp;-&nbsp;23&nbsp;µg/m³&nbsp; High</li>
 <li>&gt;23&nbsp;µg/m³&nbsp; Very High</li>
