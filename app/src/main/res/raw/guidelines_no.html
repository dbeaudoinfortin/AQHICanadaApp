    NO refers to nitric oxide (also known as nitrogen monoxide), a nitrogen oxides (NOx) family gas that comes from a mix of natural sources, such as lightning and forest fires, and human activities, especially high-temperature combustion sources like traffic and industry.
    In the atmosphere, nitric oxide quickly oxidizes to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2). High levels of NOx, particularly NO2, can be harmful and linked to respiratory issues and other health problems.
    Nitric oxide is measured in parts per billion (ppb).

    While monitoring stations directly measure nitric oxide concentrations, no scale is provided due to its short-lived nature.
