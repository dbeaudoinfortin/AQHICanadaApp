    PM 10 refers to  particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller.
    PM 10 includes coarse particles, like dust and road grit, in addition to the fine particles measured in PM 2.5.
    While larger particles are less likely to enter the bloodstream, they can still irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and can create respiratory issues.
    PM 10 is measured in micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³).
</p>

<p>
    This PM 10 scale is based on the 24-hour exposure recommendations from the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) global air quality guidelines.
</p>

<p>
    The purpose of this scale is to provide context to the raw PM 10 values.
    It should not be interpreted as a direct representation of human health risk.
