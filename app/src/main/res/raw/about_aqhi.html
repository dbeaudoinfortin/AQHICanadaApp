<p>The Canadian Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is a made-in-Canada scale developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) to provide real-time information about the health risks associated with air pollution. It combines measurements from ground-level ozone, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and nitrogen dioxide into a single numerical value on a scale from 1 (low risk) to 10 (high risk). All values above 10 are assigned a reading of 11+, indicating a very high risk.</p>
<p>
<b>Scale:</b>
 <ul> 
 <li>1-3&nbsp; Low health risk</li> 
 <li>4-6&nbsp; Moderate health risk</li> 
 <li>7-10&nbsp; High health risk</li> 
 <li>11+ &nbsp;Very high health risk</li>
</ul> </p>

<p>As per ECCC, the calculation of the AQHI may change over time to reflect new understanding associated with air pollution health effects. AQHI values are calculated automatically using observations from a network of air quality monitoring stations across Canada. These measurements are collected in real-time and are not verified prior to publication. Forecast and historical AQHI values are reported on an hourly basis.</p>
