    O3 refers to ground-level ozone, a gas that forms when nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) pollutants react with sunlight.
    Ozone is a harmful air pollutant and high levels are linked to respiratory issues and other health problems.
    Ozone is measured in parts per billion (ppb).
</p>

<p>
    This ozone scale is based on guidelines from the 2025 Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) 8-hour management levels for outdoor air across Canada.
    These levels are established by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME).
</p>

<p>
    The purpose of this scale is to provide context to the raw ozone values.
    It should not be interpreted as a direct representation of human health risk.

    <b>Scale:</b>

 <ul> 
 <li>&nbsp;≤50&nbsp;ppb&nbsp; Low</li>
