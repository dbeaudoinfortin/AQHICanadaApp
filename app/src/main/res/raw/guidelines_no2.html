    NO2 refers to nitrogen dioxide, a nitrogen oxides (NOx) family gas that mainly comes from high-temperature combustion sources like traffic and industry.
    Nitrogen dioxide is a harmful air pollutant and high levels are linked to respiratory issues and other health problems.
    Nitrogen dioxide is measured in parts per billion (ppb).
</p>

<p>
    This nitrogen dioxide scale is based on guidelines from the 2025 Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) 1-hour management levels for outdoor air across Canada.
    These levels are established by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME).
</p>

<p>
    The purpose of this scale is to provide context to the raw nitrogen dioxide values.
    It should not be interpreted as a direct representation of human health risk.

    <b>Scale:</b>

 <ul> 
 <li>&nbsp;≤20&nbsp;ppb&nbsp; Low</li>
 <li>&nbsp;20.1&nbsp;-&nbsp;31&nbsp;ppb&nbsp; Medium</li>
 <li>&nbsp;31.1&nbsp;-&nbsp;42&nbsp;ppb&nbsp; High</li>
 <li>&nbsp;&gt;42&nbsp;ppb&nbsp; Very High</li>
