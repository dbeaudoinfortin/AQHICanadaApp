## Privacy Policy
This app is made by David Fortin, an individual - not a corporation. It does not collect or share any of your personal information or data.

Your device's location is used only to identify the closest air quality monitoring station, and only if you explicitly grant the app permission to use location services. Your location information stays exclusively on your device and is never transmitted or shared.
 
This app determines your nearest air quality monitoring station by comparing your location (locally, on your device) with a list of stations obtained from Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) GeoMet service. Your location data is never sent to ECCC or any other server.
