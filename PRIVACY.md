## Privacy Policy

Effective as of July 13, 2025

This app is made by David Fortin, an individual - not a corporation. It does not collect or share any of your personal information or data.

Your device's location is used only to identify the closest air quality monitoring station, and only if you explicitly grant the app permission to use location services. Your location information stays exclusively on your device and is never transmitted or shared.
 
This app determines your nearest air quality monitoring station by comparing your location (locally, on your device) with a list of stations obtained from Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) GeoMet service. Your location data is never sent to ECCC or any other server.

This app does not use any third-party data collection SDKs, such as analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting SDKs. Because no data is collected or retained, there is no need for data-retention controls or a data-retention period.

You can view the latest privacy policy anytime by tapping the "Privacy" link in the bottom right footer of the app, or viewing it on [GitHub](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/AQHICanadaApp/blob/main/PRIVACY.md).

This app is fully open-source. You can review all source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/dbeaudoinfortin/AQHICanadaApp)</a>.
